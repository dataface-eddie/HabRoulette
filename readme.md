# HabRoulette

>HabRoullette is a PostgreSQL based app that allows users to enter in "good behaviors" or "habits"\* that they would like to work into their routine. After the user enters in these habits, the time each one takes to complete and the score to associate with that activity, they are able to start generating random habits to do. They just tell the app how many minutes of time they have to kill and the app will generate a time appropriate habit that the user can do. If the user indicates that they completed the activity, then they will receive the points associated with that habit. Each day, points are totalled so the user can track their success and gamify their good habit fomring... if they want.

   *\* We're calling them "habits", but there is an arguement that they aren't "habits" per-se because of the random nature in which this works, but there is more to good habit forming than just doing the same thing over and over again*
